hello world?!?!

missed time
by ha jin

my notebook has remained blank for months
thanks to the light you shower
around me. i have no use
for my pen, which lies
languorously without grief.

nothing is better than to live
a storyless life that needs
no writing for meaningâ€”
when i am gone, let others say
they lost a happy man,
though no one can tell how happy i was.
