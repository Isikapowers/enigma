# Self Evaluation: Enigma project

### Functionality ###
- **"Meet Expectations"** -- all of the required classes and methods are working perfectly as well as CLI.

### Object Oriented Programming ###
- **"Above Expectations"** -- project is broken into classes with a single responsibility per class.  Each is not too big nor too small and contains all information that each should have.  Moreover, a module of KeyGenerator is implemented and used across all classes.

### Ruby Conventions & Mechanics ###
- **"Above Expectations"** -- all classes and methods are well named and no methods are more than 10 lines long.  Appropriate enumerators are used.

### Test Driven Development ###
- **"Above Expectations"** -- stubs are used to make tests more robust with generating random keys.  Test coverage is 100% covered.
